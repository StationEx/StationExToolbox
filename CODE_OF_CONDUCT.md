# StationEx Code of Conduct


## Our Pledge

We pledge to make our community welcoming, safe, and equitable for all.

We are committed to fostering an environment that respects and promotes the dignity, rights, and contributions of all individuals, regardless of characteristics including race, ethnicity, caste, color, age, physical characteristics, neurodiversity, disability, sex or gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, language, philosophy or religion, national or social origin, socio-economic position, level of education, or other status. The same privileges of participation are extended to everyone who participates in good faith and in accordance with this Covenant.


## Scope

This code of conduct applies to all StationEx projects, repositories, and other community spaces.


## Standards

While acknowledging differences in social norms, we all strive to meet our community's expectations for positive behavior. We also understand that our words and actions may be interpreted differently than we intend based on culture, background, or native language.

With these considerations in mind, we agree to behave mindfully toward each other and act in ways that center our shared values, including:

- Be a respectful and honest partner when engaging with others.
- Respect the different viewpoints and experiences of others.
- Taking responsibility for our actions and contributions.
- Foster the growth of the community through the growth of others.
- Provide and accept constructive feedback. Criticize the contribution, not the contributor.
- Behave in a manner that advanced the purpose of the project, not the goals of an individual.

## Unacceptable Behaviors

We agree to restrict the following behaviors in our community. Instances, threats, and promotion of these behaviors are violations of this Code of Conduct.

- Violating explicitly expressed boundaries or engaging in unnecessary personal attention after any clear request to stop.
- Making insulting, demeaning, or pejorative comments directed at a community member or group of people.
- Characterizing anyone's personality or behavior on the basis of immutable identities or traits.
- Behaving in a way that would generally be considered inappropriately intimate in the context or purpose of the community.
- Sharing or acting on someone's personal or private information without their permission.
- Causing, encouraging, or threatening violence or other harm toward any person or group.
- Behaving in other ways that threaten the well-being of our community.
- Impersonating someone else for any reason, or pretending to be someone else to evade enforcement actions.
- Not properly crediting the sources of content you contribute.
